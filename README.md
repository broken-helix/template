## **Testing Phase**

* Responsiveness - A mobile-first approach was used to develop the site.  The site was tested for responsiveness on different screen sizes throughout the development stages, using chrome dev tools, which allowed the page to be adjusted to display on small and large screen sizes with media queries.  The site was also tested using multiple devices and adjusted to display correctly.
​
* Functionality - Each feature has been tested repeatedly during the production and testing phase.  Examples ...

* Contrast - The contrast on the page was checked using the WCAG Color contrast checker plugin in chrome and found to pass the tests, after adjustments to the colours.
